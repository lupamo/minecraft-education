# Wikipedia Knowledge Temple - Minecraft Server Project

## Project Overview
This project showcases a Minecraft server featuring an interactive Wikipedia Knowledge Temple. The temple serves as an educational space dedicated to Wikipedia, featuring different rooms that highlight various aspects of the Wikimedia movement through interactive gameplay elements.

## Server Setup Process

### Hosting Configuration
For this project, I used Aternos as the hosting service due to its user-friendly interface and complete file access capabilities. The setup process involved:

1. Creating an account on [Aternos](https://aternos.org)
2. Setting up a new Minecraft Java Edition server (version 1.19.4)
3. Configuring server properties:
   * Game mode: Adventure (to preserve builds)
   * Difficulty: Peaceful
   * PvP: Disabled
   * View distance: 10 chunks (for performance)
   * Spawn protection: 16 blocks

### Building the Knowledge Temple

The Wikipedia Knowledge Temple was constructed using the following approach:

1. **Planning Phase:**
   * Designed a temple layout with distinct areas for different Wikipedia themes
   * Selected appropriate building materials to match the educational atmosphere
   * Planned interactive elements for visitor engagement

2. **Main Structure:**
   * Built the temple entrance featuring the Wikipedia puzzle globe logo using colored wool blocks
   * Created a central hall with branching pathways to different themed rooms
   * Used quartz and stone brick as primary building materials to create a scholarly atmosphere

3. **Interactive Elements:**
   * **Quiz Room:** Implemented a Wikipedia facts quiz using pressure plates and redstone mechanisms
   * **Did You Know Corner:** Created an exhibition with signs displaying interesting Wikipedia statistics
   * **Growth Visualization:** Built a block-based chart showing Wikipedia's article growth using differently colored blocks to represent years
   * **Pillars of Wikipedia Room:** Created representations of Wikipedia's core principles

## Creative Choices

I chose to create a temple-themed structure to represent the reverence for knowledge that Wikipedia embodies. The temple metaphor connects to Wikipedia's role as a repository of human knowledge, with each room highlighting different aspects of Wikipedia's mission and impact.

The interactive quiz was designed to engage visitors while teaching them about Wikipedia's history and significance. The "Did You Know" section provides interesting facts that highlight the scale and importance of Wikipedia. The growth visualization gives a tangible representation of Wikipedia's expansion over time.

These elements collectively demonstrate Wikipedia's commitment to free knowledge sharing and community collaboration, core principles of the Wikimedia movement.

## How to Join the Server

To join the Wikipedia Knowledge Temple server:

1. Open Minecraft Java Edition (version 1.19.4)
2. Click "Multiplayer" from the main menu
3. Click "Add Server"
4. Enter any server name (e.g., "Wikipedia Temple")
5. For the server address, enter: `wikitemple.aternos.me`
6. Click "Done" and join the server

**Note:** As this is hosted on Aternos' free tier, the server automatically shuts down when no players are online. If you find the server offline, please message me and I can start it up for you to explore!

## Future Enhancements

If continued, this project could be expanded with:
* More interactive quizzes covering additional Wikipedia topics
* A Wikipedia editing simulation room
* International language rooms representing Wikipedia's global reach
* Redstone-powered animations demonstrating wiki editing concepts
